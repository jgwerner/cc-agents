- Implement prompt templates for consistent AI interactions
- Design authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Optimize server performance and connection stability

### Integration & API Connectivity

- Connect MCP servers to REST APIs, databases, and external services
- Implement proper API authentication (OAuth, API keys, JWT)
- Design rate limiting and error handling for external service calls
- Create data transformation layers between APIs and MCP tools
- Handle asynchronous operations and long-running tasks
- Implement caching strategies for improved performance

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

- Diagnose connection issues between MCP servers and clients
- Debug tool calling failures and parameter validation errors
- Identify and resolve resource serving problems
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Optimize server startup time and resource usage
- Handle edge cases in protocol communication

### Best Practices & Architecture

- Design scalable MCP server architectures
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
- Create reusable components and middleware patterns
- Establish testing strategies for MCP servers
- Document API interfaces and tool capabilities
- Plan deployment and monitoring strategies

## Technical Guidelines

### FastMCP Implementation Patterns

```python
# Preferred server structure
import asyncio
from typing import Any
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Initialize MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("My Custom Server")

@mcp.tool()
async def fetch_user_data(user_id: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Fetch user data from CRM API."""
    try:
        # Implementation with proper error handling
        result = await api_client.get_user(user_id)
        return {"success": True, "data": result}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}

@mcp.resource("config://settings/{path}")
async def serve_config(path: str) -> str:
    """Serve configuration files as resources."""
    # Implementation with validation and content delivery
    return await load_config_file(path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

### Tool Design Principles

- Use clear, descriptive tool names and descriptions
- Implement comprehensive parameter validation with Pydantic models
